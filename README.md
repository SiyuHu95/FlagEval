### Overview

**FlagEval** is an evaluation toolkit for AI large foundation models. Our goal is to explore and integrate **scientific**, **fair** and **open** foundation model evaluation benchmarks, methods and tools. FlagEval will support **multi-dimensional** evaluation (such as accuracy, efficiency, robustness, etc.) of foundation models in/cross different modalities (such as NLP, audio, CV and multimodal) in the future. We hope that through the evaluation of the foundation models, we can deepen the understanding of the foundation models and promote related technological innovation and industrial application.

* A evaluation toolkit [**mCLIPEval**](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEval/tree/master/mCLIPEval) for vision-language models (such as CLIP, Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pre-training).
	- Multilingual (12 languages) datasets and monolingual (English/Chinese) datasets.
	- Support for zeroshot classification, zeroshot retrieval and zeroshot composition tasks.
	- Adapted to [FlagAI](https://github.com/FlagAI-Open/FlagAI) pretrained models ([AltCLIP](https://github.com/FlagAI-Open/FlagAI/tree/master/examples/AltCLIP), [EVA-CLIP](https://github.com/FlagAI-Open/FlagAI/tree/master/examples/EVA_CLIP)), [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip) pretrained models, [Chinese CLIP](https://github.com/OFA-Sys/Chinese-CLIP) models, [Multilingual CLIP](https://github.com/FreddeFrallan/Multilingual-CLIP) models, [Taiyi Series](https://fengshenbang-doc.readthedocs.io/zh/latest/docs/%E5%A4%AA%E4%B9%99%E7%B3%BB%E5%88%97/index.html) pretrained models, or customized models.
	- Data preparation from various resources, like [torchvision](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/datasets.html), [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), etc.
	- Visualization of evaluation results through leaderboard figures or tables, and detailed comparsions between two specific models.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Environment Preparation
* Pytorch version >= 1.8.0
* Python version >= 3.8
* For evaluating models on GPUs, you'll also need install CUDA and NCCL

### How to use [mCLIPEval](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEval/tree/master/mCLIPEval)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEval.git
cd FlagEval/mCLIPEval/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please refer to [mCLIPEval/README.md](https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEval/tree/master/mCLIPEval/README.md) for more details.
